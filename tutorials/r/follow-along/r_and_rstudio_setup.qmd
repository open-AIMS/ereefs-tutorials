Learn how to setup R and RStudio and follow along with the eReefs tutorials.
:::


## R and RStudio setup

Download and install `R` (the programming language) and RStudio (the integrated development environment)
following these [RStudio installation instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

## Linux dependencies

RStudio makes it easy to install the required R packages, but it canâ€™t install any system-level
(Linux) dependencies. These need to be installed separately.

On Ubuntu, you can install those dependencies using the following command:
```{bash installSystemPackages}
#| eval: false
sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgeos-dev libudunits2-dev libsqlite3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libfreetype-dev libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev
```

## Running R code in RStudio

Open RStudio and create a new project: *File > New Project > New Directory > New Project*.
Click `New File` in the bottom-right panel, and choose `R Script`.
The new R file will open in the main panel of RStudio.

You can now copy / paste code chunks from the tutorial page, by clicking the
`r fontawesome::fa(name = "clipboard")` button in the right corner of each chunk.
Make sure you run them in order.

## Installing R packages

You may encounter the situation where an R package used in the tutorials have not yet been installed on your
machine. You can install the package manually by running the following command:

```{r installingPackages}
#| eval: false
install.packages("<package name>")  # replace <package name> with the name of the R package you wish to install
```
