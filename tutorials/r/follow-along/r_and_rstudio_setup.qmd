Learn how to setup R and RStudio and follow along with the eReefs tutorials.
:::


## R and RStudio setup

Download and install `R` (the programming language) and RStudio (the integrated development environment)
following these [RStudio installation instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

## Linux dependencies

RStudio will automatically detect and install the required R packages, but it canâ€™t install any system-level
(Linux) dependencies. These need to be installed separately.

On Ubuntu, you can install those dependencies using the following command:
```{bash installSystemPackages}
#| eval: false
sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgeos-dev libudunits2-dev libsqlite3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libfreetype-dev libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev
```

## Download tutorial files

The eReefs tutorials for R are located in the
[ereefs-tutorials GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-AIMS/ereefs-tutorials).
Download the repository's code by clicking *Code > Download ZIP*.
After unzipping the repository's Zip archive, you will find each R tutorial placed in its own folder,
under `ereefs-tutorials-main/tutorials/r`.

## Open tutorial in RStudio

Open RStudio and create a new project: *File > New Project > Existing Directory > Browse > select the
tutorial folder*. Then open the main tutorial `qmd` file from the *Files* tab, in the bottom-right
panel of RStudio.

The project will open in the main panel of RStudio. To ensure everything runs smoothly, make sure you're in
*Source* editing mode, in the top-left corner of the editor. The *Visual* mode can cause issues with running
R code reliably.

You can now run the code chunks within the tutorial by clicking the
`r fontawesome::fa(name="play", fill = "green")` button in the top-right corner of each chunk, in order.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Chunks can also be run be pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*,
and sections of code (e.g. half a line, a single line, multiple lines) can be run
by selecting the code and pressing *Ctrl+Enter* (replace *Ctrl* with *Cmd* on Mac).

## Installing R packages

You may encounter the situation where an R package used in the tutorials have not yet been installed on your
machine. Installing packages in R is easy, just run the following command from an open R console:

```{r installingPackages}
#| eval: false
install.packages("<package name>")  # replace <package name> with the name of the R package you wish to install
```
