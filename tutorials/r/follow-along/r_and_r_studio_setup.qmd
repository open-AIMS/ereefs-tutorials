Learn how to setup R and R Studio and follow along with the eReefs tutorials.
:::


## R and R Studio setup

Download and install `R` (the programming language) and R Studio (the integrated development environment)
following the instructions [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).


## Download tutorial files

The eReefs tutorials for R are located
[here](https://github.com/open-AIMS/ereefs-tutorials/tree/main/tutorials/r).
Each tutorial is placed in its own folder, so to follow along with any particular tutorial just download the
respective folder and unzip it in a suitable place on your computer.

## Open tutorial in R Studio

Open R Studio and create a new project: File > New Project > Existing Directory > Browse > select the
unzipped tutorial folder created. Then open the main tutorial (`*.qmd`).

You can now run the code chunks within the tutorial by clicking the
`r fontawesome::fa(name="play", fill = "green")` button in the top right corner. Chunks can also be run be
pressing ctrl+shift+enter and sections of code (e.g. half a line, a single line, multiple lines) can be run
by selecting the section and pressing ctrl+enter (replace ctrl with cmd on Mac).

## Installing R packages

You may encounter the situation where an R package used in the tutorials have not yet been installed on your
machine. Installing packages in R is easy, just run the following from an open R console or R code chunk
within an R markdown (`*.rmd`) or Quarto markdown (`*.qmd`) file:

```{r installingPackages, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("<package name>")  # replace <package name> with the name of the R package you wish to install
```
