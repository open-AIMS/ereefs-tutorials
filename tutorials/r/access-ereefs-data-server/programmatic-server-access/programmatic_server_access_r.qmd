This tutorial builds on the techniques introduced in [Access eReefs data: Basic server access {{< fa brands r-project >}}](../basic-server-access/basic_server_access_r.qmd).
:::

In this tutorial we will look at how to get eReefs data from the [AIMS server](http://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog.html) corresponding to the logged locations of tagged marine animals. Keep in mind, however, that the same methodology can be applied in any situation where we wish to extract eReefs data for a range of points with different dates of interest for each point. 

## R packages
```{r RPackages}
library(RNetCDF) # to access server data files via OPeNDAP
library(readr) # to efficiently read in data
library(janitor) # to create consistent, 'clean' variable names
library(tidyverse) # for data manipulation and plotting with ggplot2
library(lubridate) # for working with date and time variables 
library(leaflet) # to create an interactive map of the tracking locations
library(knitr); library(kableExtra) # for better table printing
```

## Motivating problem

The tracking of marine animals is commonly used by researchers to gain insights into the distribution, biology, behaviour and ecology of different species. However, knowing where an animal was at a certain point in time is only one piece of the puzzle. To start to understand *why* an animal was where it was, we usually require information on things like: What type of habitat is present at the location? What were the environmental conditions like at the time? What other lifeforms were present at the tracked location (e.g. for food or mating)?

In this tutorial we will pretend that we have tracking data for Loggerhead Sea Turtles and wish to get eReefs data corresponding to the tracked points (in time and space) to understand more about the likely environmental conditions experienced by our turtles.

# Read more: Tracking marine animals

Marine animals are typically tracked using either acoustic or satellite tags. These tags are attached to the animals and transmit signals back to recievers, logging the animal's location at different points in time. In some cases other data such as depth, temperature, and animal movement profiles are recorded and the data transmitted to the recievers whenever possible. 

Acoustic tracking requires a network of recievers to be placed in the ocean in order to pick up the tags' transmitted signals when they come within range (typically around 500 m). Acoustic tracking has the advantage of being able transmit and recieve signals underwater, however is limited by the coverage of the reciever network. In some instances, researchers do without the reciever network and follow the animals around in a boat to receive the data. The suitability of acoustic tracking depends on the study species and research question. 

Satellite tracking, on the other hand, is able to track animals over virtually the entire ocean as the tags transmit signals to a network of satellites orbiting the earth. However, unlike acoustic tags, the signals cannot be transmitted through water and the tagged animals must breach the ocean surface in order to have their location logged and any other recorded data be received. The accuracy of the logged location depends on the quality of the transmitted signal. For high-quality signals, the location uncertainty can be in the hundreds of metres, however for bad quality signals this can blow out to over 10 km.

:::

## Example tracking data

We will use satellite tracking data for Loggerhead Sea Turtles (*Caretta caretta*) provided in [Strydom (2022)](https://doi.org/10.15468/k4s6ap). This data contains tracking detections which span the length of the Great Barrier Reef off the east coast of Queensland Australia from December 2021 to April 2022 (shown in @fig-data-map).

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
This dataset is a summarized representation of the tracking locations per 1-degree cell. This implies a coordinate uncertainty of roughly 110 km. This level of uncertainty renders the data virtually useless for most practical applications, though it will suffice for the purposes of this tutorial. Records which are landbased as a result of the uncertainty have been removed and from here on in we will just pretend that the coordinates are accurate.
:::

```{r dataImportMap}
#| fig-cap: Loggerhead Sea Turtle satellite tracking records (December 2021 - April 2022)
#| label: fig-data-map

# Read in data
loggerhead_data <- read_csv("data/Loggerhead_Sea_Turtle_satellite_tracking_detections__Strydom_2022_DOI10-15468-k4s6ap.csv") |> 
  clean_names() |> # clean up variable names
  rename( # rename variables for easier use
    record_id = gbif_id,
    latitude = decimal_latitude, 
    longitude = decimal_longitude, 
    date_time = event_date
  )

# Remove land based records (as a result of coordinate uncertainty)
land_based_records <- c(4022992331, 4022992326, 4022992312, 4022992315, 4022992322, 4022992306)
loggerhead_data <- loggerhead_data |> 
  dplyr::filter(!(record_id %in% land_based_records))

# Select the variables relevant to this tutorial
loggerhead_data <- loggerhead_data |> 
  select(longitude, latitude, date_time, record_id, species)

# View the tracking locations on an interactive map
loggerhead_data |> 
  leaflet() |> 
  addTiles() |> 
  addMarkers(label = ~date_time)
```


## Extracting data from the server

We will extend the basic methods introduced in  the preceeding tutorial [Accessing eReefs data from the AIMS server](../basic-server-access/basic_server_access_r.qmd) to extract data for a set of points and dates. 

We will extract the eReefs daily mean temperature (`temp`), salinity (`salt`), and east- and northward current velocities (`u` and `v`) corresponding to the coordinates and dates for the tracking detections shown in @tbl-detections.


```{r detectionsTable}
#| tbl-cap: Loggerhead Sea Turtle detections (Strydom, 2022)
#| label: tbl-detections
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code to produce table
# Print table of tracking detections (Strydom, 2022)
loggerhead_data |> 
  arrange(date_time) |> 
  mutate(date = format(date_time, "%Y-%m-%d"), time = format(date_time, "%H:%M")) |>
  select(date, time, longitude, latitude) |> 
  kable() |> kable_styling() |> scroll_box(height = "300px", fixed_thead = TRUE)
```

<br>

We will take advantage of the consistent file naming on the server to extract the data of interest programatically. We will first need to copy the OPeNDAP data link for one of the files within the correct model and aggregation folders and then replace the date. 

Selecting a random date within the daily aggregated data with one data file per day (`daily-daily`) for the 1km hydro model (`gbr1_2.0`), we see the files have the naming format:

`https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/dodsC/s3://aims-ereefs-public-prod/derived/ncaggregate/ereefs/gbr1_2.0/daily-daily/EREEFS_AIMS-CSIRO_gbr1_2.0_hydro_daily-daily-`[YYYY-MM-DD]{style="color: red"}`.nc`

We will now write a script which extracts the data for the dates and coordinates in @tbl-detections. For each unique date we will open the corresponding file on the server and extract the daily mean temperature, salinity, northward and southward current velocities for each set of coordinates corresponding to the date.

```{r extractData}
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| message: true
 
# GET DATA FOR EACH DATE AND COORDINATE (LAT LON) PAIR
t_start = Sys.time() # to track run time of extraction

## 1. Setup variables for data extraction
# Server file name = <file_prefix><date (yyyy-mm-dd)><file_suffix>
file_prefix <- "https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/dodsC/s3://aims-ereefs-public-prod/derived/ncaggregate/ereefs/gbr1_2.0/daily-daily/EREEFS_AIMS-CSIRO_gbr1_2.0_hydro_daily-daily-"
file_suffix <- ".nc"

# Table of dates and coordinates for which to extract data (dates as character string)
detections <- loggerhead_data |> 
  mutate(date = as.character(as_date(date_time))) |>
  select(date, longitude, latitude) |> 
  distinct()

extracted_data <- data.frame() # to save the extracted data
dates <- unique(detections$date) # unique dates for which to open server files

## 2. For each date of interest, open a connection to the corresponding data file on the server
for (i in 1:length(dates)) {
  date_i <- dates[i]
  
  # Open file
  file_name_i <- paste0(file_prefix, date_i, file_suffix)
  server_file_i <- open.nc(file_name_i)

  # Coordinates for which to extract data for the current date
  coordinates_i <- detections |> dplyr::filter(date == date_i)

  # Get all coordinates in the open file (each representing the center-point of the corresponding grid cell)
  server_lons_i <- var.get.nc(server_file_i, "longitude")
  server_lats_i <- var.get.nc(server_file_i, "latitude")

  ## 3. For each coordinate (lon, lat) for the current date, get the data for the closest grid cell (1km^2) from the open server file
  for (j in 1:nrow(coordinates_i)) {
    
    # Current coordinate of interest
    lon_j <- coordinates_i[j,]$longitude
    lat_j <- coordinates_i[j,]$latitude
        
    # Find the index of the grid cell containing our coordinate of interest (i.e. the center-point closest to our point of interest)
    lon_index <- which.min(abs(server_lons_i - lon_j))
    lat_index <- which.min(abs(server_lats_i - lat_j))

    # Setup start vector arguments for RNetCDF::var.get.nc (same for temp, salt, currents u & v)
    ###################################
    # Recall the order of the dimensions (longitude, latitude, k, time) from the previous tutorial. Therefore we want [lon_index, lat_index, k = 16 corresponding to a depth of 0.5m, time = 1 (as we're using the daily files this is the only option)]. If you are still confused go back to the previous tutorial or have a look at the structure of one of the server files by uncommenting the following 5 lines of code:
    # not_yet_run = TRUE  # used so the following lines are only run once
    # if (not_yet_run) { 
    #   print.nc(server_file_i)
    #   not_yet_run = FALSE
    # }
    ##################################
    start_j <- c(lon_index, lat_index, 16, 1) # k = 16 corresponds to depth = 0.5m
    count_j <- c(1, 1, 1, 1) # only extracting a single value for each variable

    # Get the data for the grid cell containing our point of interest
    temp_j <- var.get.nc(server_file_i, "temp", start_j, count_j)
    salt_j <- var.get.nc(server_file_i, "salt", start_j, count_j)
    u_j <- var.get.nc(server_file_i, "u", start_j, count_j)
    v_j <- var.get.nc(server_file_i, "v", start_j, count_j)
    extracted_data_j <- data.frame(date_i, lon_j, lat_j, temp_j, salt_j, u_j, v_j)

    ## 4. Save data in memory and repeat for next date-coordinate pair
    extracted_data <- rbind(extracted_data, extracted_data_j)
  }
  # Close connection to open server file and move to the next date
  close.nc(server_file_i)
}

# Calculate the run time of the extraction
t_stop <- Sys.time()
extract_time <- t_stop - t_start

# Rename the extracted data columns
colnames(extracted_data) <- c("date", "lon", "lat", "temp", "salt", "u", "v")
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
In the code above we match the closest eReefs model grid cell to each point in our list of coordinates (i.e. for each tracking detection). This will therefore match grid cells to all the coordinates, even if they are not within the eReefs model boundary. This behaviour may be useful when we have points right along the coastline as the eReefs models have small gaps at many points along the coast (see image below). However, in other cases this behaviour may not be desirable. For example, if we had points down near Sydney they would be matched to the closest eReefs grid cells (somewhere up near Brisbane) and the extracted data would be erroneous.

:::

Our extracted data is shown below in @tbl-extracted-data. To get this data we openned `r length(dates)` files on the server (corresponding to unique dates in @tbl-detections) and extracted data for `r nrow(detections)` unique date-coordinate pairs. On our machine this took `r paste(round(as.numeric(extract_time), 1), units(extract_time))` to run.

```{r extractedDataTable}
#| tbl-cap: Extracted daily mean temperature, salinity, and east- and northward current velocities (u, v respectively) for Loggerhead Sea Turtle detections (Strydom, 2022)
#| label: tbl-extracted-data

# Print the extracted data
extracted_data |> kable() |> kable_styling() |> scroll_box(height = "300px", fixed_thead = TRUE)
```


## Matching extracted data to tracking data

We will match up the eReefs data with our tracking detections by combining the two datasets based on common date, longitude and latitude values.

```{r matchedDataTable}
#| tbl-cap: Loggerhead Sea Turtle tracking detections (Strydom, 2022) and corresponding eReefs daily mean temperature, salinity, east- and northward current velocities (u, v respectively).
#| label: tbl-combined-data

# Ensure common variables date, lon and lat between the two datasets
extracted_data <- extracted_data |> 
  rename(longitude = lon, latitude = lat)
loggerhead_data <- loggerhead_data |> 
  mutate(date = as_date(date_time))

# Merge the two datasets based on common date, lon and lat values
combined_data <- merge(
  loggerhead_data, extracted_data, 
  by = c("date", "longitude", "latitude")
) |> select(-date)

# Print the combined data
combined_data |> kable() |> kable_styling() |>  scroll_box(height = "300px", fixed_thead = TRUE)
```

Hooray! We now have our combined dataset of the Loggerhead Sea Turtle tracking detections and the corresponding eReefs daily aggregated data (@tbl-combined-data).
