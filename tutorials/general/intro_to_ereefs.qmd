## What is *eReefs*?

The Great Barrier Reef (the Reef) is the largest coral reef system on earth, covering an area of about
350,000 km$^2$ off the coast of Queensland, Australia. It is an ecosystem of immense complexity, with a
myriad of physical, chemical and biological processes interacting through time to shape the reef which we see
today and into the future.

Tracking the health of the Reef has become increasingly important as the cumulative impacts of a range of
stressors intensify under a changing climate and jeopardise the future of the Reef as we know it. While the
Reef's great economic, cultural and social value does fuel a considerable amount of research and investment,
its shear size means that observations of its condition are relatively few and far between. *eReefs* aims to
solve this problem by using computer modelling to simulate some of the key processes shaping the Reef ---
from the catchments, to the rivers and estuaries, to the reef lagoon, reef matrix and open ocean --- to
better understand the ecosystem as a whole and monitor its health in (near) real-time.

Put simply, *eReefs* is an information platform which takes data from a wide range of sources and passes it
through a series of computer models to get predictions across a number of key attributes of the Great Barrier
Reef, such as water temperature, water chemistry, and nutrient and sediment loads. These predictions are
routinely generated across the entire extent of the Great Barrier Reef, in near-real-time. The end result is
a collection of datasets which are, essentially, snapshots of the Reef's condition through time. These
datasets are the core output of *eReefs*, with a number of other data products, visualisations, and services
built upon them.

A simplified overview of the *eReefs* information platform is shown in @fig-overviewSimple.

## The *eReefs* Platform

*eReefs* is often described as an 'information platform' to capture the wide range of information services
which can be built upon it. Some examples of these services, along with the different elements which make up
the *eReefs* platform, are shown in @fig-overviewFull.

```{r ImgEreefsOverviewFull, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "A schematic overview of the eReefs platform."
#| label: fig-overviewFull
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/ereefs_overview.png")
```

Many different *Research Components* are used to transform input data into a range of data products. These
are mostly computer models (more specifically, numerical models), and include:

* *Ocean Colour* - An optical model which uses satellite imagery to infer the optical properties,
  i.e. colour, of the waters in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. The colour of the water actually contains a
  lot of information on water quality, including things like sediment loads and types, the location of river
  plumes and phytoplankton blooms, and water circulation structures.

* *Regional Models* - These are the core of the *eReefs* platform. They include a hydrodynamic model to
  predict the physical state of the system, a sediment transport model predicting the fate of suspended fine
  sediments, and a biogeochemical model for water column and benthic production, water quality and nutrient
  cycling. These models are run across the entire extent of the Great Barrier Reef, from the coastline to the
  open ocean, at either 4 km or 1 km resolution.

* *Relocatable Coastal Models (RECOM)* - An automated re-locatable modelling system capable of generating
  high resolution models of hydrodynamics, waves, sediment transport and biogeochemistry, nested within the
  4 km or 1 km regional models. Essentially, RECOM implements the regional models over a smaller,
  user-defined area with much higher resolution.

* *Marine Forecasting Models* - Provide what is essentially a marine weather forecast, capable of providing
  short-term predictions of water temperature, flow, mixing and quality, among other things.

* *Catchment Models* - Predict the flow of water entering the catchments via rainfall and exiting into the
  ocean via rivers, as well as the introduction of sediments and pollutants via run-off.


In @fig-obsInfra we can see the extents of the 4 km and 1 km regional models and the catchment models, along
with the locations of the in-field input data streams.

```

## The *eReefs* Regional Models

The Regional Models are the core of the *eReefs* platform and include three main models, the:

* **Hydrodynamic model** - predicts the physical state of the system

* **Sediment transport model** - predicts the fate of suspended fine sediments

* **Biogeochemical model** - predicts many attributes of water column and benthic production, water quality
  and nutrient cycling

These models are supported by a wave model, an optical model, a carbon chemistry and reef processes model,
catchment models and data assimilation systems.

#| label: fig-regionalModels
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/regional_models.jpg")
```

### Model grids and extents

The models are run using a curvilinear orthogonal grid, where their total spatial extent is divided into many
grid cells (a.k.a. pixels) at both 4 km and 1 km resolution; dubbed the **GBR4** and **GBR1** models,
respectively. For each grid cell, the models predict values across a consistent set of reef attributes at a
range of depths in the water column.

Both the GBR1 and GBR4 models extend along the Queensland coast from Papua New Guinea to the New South Wales
border, and offshore to beyond the continental slope. The 4 km model encompasses some of the Western Coral
Sea and the Queensland Plateau, whereas the 1 km model is limited to the shelf regions. The boundaries of
both models are shown in @fig-modelBoundariesGrids along with the grid sizes.

```{r ImgModelBoundaries, echo=FALSE}

```

# Relocatable Coastal Model (RECOM)
In addition to the 4 km and 1 km resolution models, the eReefs platform also contains a Relocatable Coastal
Model (RECOM) which offers higher resolution over smaller, user-defined areas. We do not yet cover the use of
RECOM in these tutorials.

## The *eReefs* Outputs

The core outputs from the *eReefs* platform are the datasets produced by the Hydrodynamic and Biogeochemical
Regional Models. These datasets contain the predicted values across a range of variables for different points
in time and three-dimensional space (latitude, longitude and depth in the water column and benthic layers).
The datasets are produced routinely in near-real-time, and hindcast into the past. The outputs are available
in both 4 km and 1 km resolution. An overview of the different raw model outputs available on the
[National Computer Infrastructure (NCI) *eReefs* server](https://thredds.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/catalogs/fx3/catalog.html)
is shown in @tbl-outputsOverview, the different variables contained in each model is presented in
[Model output variables](intro_to_ereefs.qmd#sec-modelVariables).

### Accessing outputs {#sec-accessingModelData}

The eReefs Hydrodynamic and Biogeochemical model outputs are available in two types:

* **Raw outputs** - Unprocessed model outputs published by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
  Research Organisation (CSIRO) on the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) server. They contain the
  model outputs at hourly (Hydrodynamic) or daily (Biogeochemical) time intervals.

* **Aggregated outputs** - Daily, monthly, and yearly aggregated model outputs processed and published by
  the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) on the AIMS eReefs THREDDS server. They contain
  aggregated model outputs whereby, for a given variable and model grid cell, the raw model output values
  are collected and processed to get the either the daily, monthly or yearly mean value.

The output datasets can be accessed in a range of different ways --- these are listed below.

## Using *eReefs* Data

### Applications

Reef management challenges for which the eReefs modelling suite has application are numerous and include
prediction of coral bleaching hotspots, impacts of ocean acidification on coral calcification, catchment
impacts on reef health (sedimentation issues, eutrophication), crown of thorns starfish (COTS) infestations,
hypoxia, management of dredging, shipping and port related activities, fisheries management, search and
rescue, larval connectivity and prediction of impacts of floods or extreme weather events on marine systems.
Since the modelling package operates routinely in near real-time, emergent events such as floods, dredge
plumes, phytoplankton blooms, cyclones, vessel groundings, bleaching events etc. may be investigated and
responded to in a timely manner.



### Limitations

The *eReefs* Hydrodynamic and Biogeochemical (BGC) datasets are based on spatial and temporal models, and as
such only provide estimates of the environmental conditions. The data does not come from in-water
measurements and thus will have a spatially varying level of error in the modelled values.

For further information on model accuracy and validation, see the
[*eReefs* research paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/1755876X.2019.1650589).

A [technical assessment of the skill level of the BGC version 3.1 model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2020/08/Reanalysis_v1_August2020.pdf)
shows that the absolute accuracy of the BGC model varies significantly with variable and location. As a
result care should be taken to ensure the model is fit-for-purpose and in general BGC results should used in
combination with second sources of information when making inferences or management decisions.

The modelled scenarios run for version 3.1 of the BGC model were developed for the purpose of comparing
catchment run off effect comparison. As such they were driven with historic weather and river flow boundary
conditions, but the sediment and nutrient loads were based on the results of the 2019 Source Catchment
modelling. In this catchment modelling the land use is static over the simulation run. This means that for
the 'Baseline' scenario this uses estimated land use from 2019 applied over all years (2010 - 2019). As a
result improvements in land practices are effectively back dated to start of the simulation (2010). This
results in early years in the simulation having slightly lower nutrient and sediment loads then actually
happened. The BGC modelling team indicated this approach is likely to introduce small additional errors in
places where the land practices have improved significantly, but are likely to be smaller than the inherent
errors in the model. These errors only apply if the Baseline model data is interpreted as an estimate of
historic conditions, rather than the original intended purpose of the scenario comparison.

The wind data used for the Hydrodynamic model is originally from the BOM Access-R weather models. These
models capture synoptic winds and some of the features of cyclones, however they do not represent the high
speed winds near the eye of cyclones well. For this reason the maximum wind speed aggregations do not capture
the peak winds of cyclones.



```{r include=FALSE}
# Notes

# Modelled data is not real data (tradeoff between coverage and data quality; eReefs represents the cutting-edge of environmental modelling and is validated by real data; fine scale currents not captured; )

# Resolution (eReefs is aimed at providing a picture of the condition of the GBR in its entirety; with a minimum resolution of 1km it is not super useful for studies or application on small scale; the RECOM model may be useful in these instances)

# Complexity of models and datasets (the eReefs modelling system is necessarily complex and a thorough understanding of its inner workings would take years to develop for most users; similarly the output datasets are also very large and the NetCDF format is likely to be new to a lot of people and takes time to become comfortable with extracting, processing, visualising and using the data; this complexity presents a barrier to entry for many potential users)
