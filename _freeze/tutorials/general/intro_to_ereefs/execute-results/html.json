It is an ecosystem of immense complexity, with a\nmyriad of physical, chemical and biological processes interacting through time to shape the reef which we see\ntoday and into the future.\n\nTracking the health of the Reef has become increasingly important as the cumulative impacts of a range of\nstressors intensify under a changing climate and jeopardise the future of the Reef as we know it. While the\nReef's great economic, cultural and social value does fuel a considerable amount of research and investment,\nits shear size means that observations of its condition are relatively few and far between. *eReefs* aims to\nsolve this problem by using computer modelling to simulate some of the key processes shaping the Reef ---\nfrom the catchments, to the rivers and estuaries, to the reef lagoon, reef matrix and open ocean --- to\nbetter understand the ecosystem as a whole and monitor its health in (near) real-time.\n\nPut simply, *eReefs* is an information platform which takes data from a wide range of sources and passes it\nthrough a series of computer models to get predictions across a number of key attributes of the Great Barrier\nReef, such as water temperature, water chemistry, and nutrient and sediment loads. These predictions are\nroutinely generated across the entire extent of the Great Barrier Reef, in near-real-time. The end result is\na collection of datasets which are, essentially, snapshots of the Reef's condition through time. These\ndatasets are the core output of *eReefs*, with a number of other data products, visualisations, and services\nbuilt upon them.\n\nA simplified overview of the *eReefs* information platform is shown in @fig-overviewSimple.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A simplified overview of the *eReefs* information platform.](../../images/ereefs_overview_custom.png){#fig-overviewSimple fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## The *eReefs* Platform\n\n*eReefs* is often described as an 'information platform' to capture the wide range of information services\nwhich can be built upon it. Some examples of these services, along with the different elements which make up\nthe *eReefs* platform, are shown in @fig-overviewFull.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A schematic overview of the eReefs platform.](../../images/ereefs_overview.png){#fig-overviewFull fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nMany different *Research Components* are used to transform input data into a range of data products. These\nare mostly computer models (more specifically, numerical models), and include:\n\n* *Ocean Colour* - An optical model which uses satellite imagery to infer the optical properties,\n  i.e. colour, of the waters in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. The colour of the water actually contains a\n  lot of information on water quality, including things like sediment loads and types, the location of river\n  plumes and phytoplankton blooms, and water circulation structures.\n\n* *Regional Models* - These are the core of the *eReefs* platform. They include a hydrodynamic model to\n  predict the physical state of the system, a sediment transport model predicting the fate of suspended fine\n  sediments, and a biogeochemical model for water column and benthic production, water quality and nutrient\n  cycling. These models are run across the entire extent of the Great Barrier Reef, from the coastline to the\n  open ocean, at either 4 km or 1 km resolution.\n\n* *Relocatable Coastal Models (RECOM)* - An automated re-locatable modelling system capable of generating\n  high resolution models of hydrodynamics, waves, sediment transport and biogeochemistry, nested within the\n  4 km or 1 km regional models. Essentially, RECOM implements the regional models over a smaller,\n  user-defined area with much higher resolution.\n\n* *Marine Forecasting Models* - Provide what is essentially a marine weather forecast, capable of providing\n  short-term predictions of water temperature, flow, mixing and quality, among other things.\n\n* *Catchment Models* - Predict the flow of water entering the catchments via rainfall and exiting into the\n  ocean via rivers, as well as the introduction of sediments and pollutants via run-off.\n\n\nIn @fig-obsInfra we can see the extents of the 4 km and 1 km regional models and the catchment models, along\nwith the locations of the in-field input data streams.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Map of the eReefs GBR1 (1 km resolution) and GBR4 (4 km resolution) model domains; the observational infrastructure which routinely collects in-field data for use as model inputs and model validation; and the extent of catchment models which predict water flows and run-off from the land.](../../images/ereefs_domain_and_observational_infrastructure.jpeg){#fig-obsInfra fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The *eReefs* Regional Models\n\nThe Regional Models are the core of the *eReefs* platform and include three main models, the:\n\n* **Hydrodynamic model** - predicts the physical state of the system\n\n* **Sediment transport model** - predicts the fate of suspended fine sediments\n\n* **Biogeochemical model** - predicts many attributes of water column and benthic production, water quality\n  and nutrient cycling\n\nThese models are supported by a wave model, an optical model, a carbon chemistry and reef processes model,\ncatchment models and data assimilation systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Model grids and extents\n\nThe models are run using a curvilinear orthogonal grid, where their total spatial extent is divided into many\ngrid cells (a.k.a. pixels) at both 4 km and 1 km resolution; dubbed the **GBR4** and **GBR1** models,\nrespectively. For each grid cell, the models predict values across a consistent set of reef attributes at a\nrange of depths in the water column.\n\nBoth the GBR1 and GBR4 models extend along the Queensland coast from Papua New Guinea to the New South Wales\nborder, and offshore to beyond the continental slope. The 4 km model encompasses some of the Western Coral\nSea and the Queensland Plateau, whereas the 1 km model is limited to the shelf regions. The boundaries of\nboth models are shown in @fig-modelBoundariesGrids along with the grid sizes.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![eReefs GBR1 (1 km resolution) and GBR4 (4 km resolution) model boundaries and grid sizes.](../../images/gbr1_gbr4_model_boundaries_and_grids.jpeg){#fig-modelBoundariesGrids fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n# Relocatable Coastal Model (RECOM)\nIn addition to the 4 km and 1 km resolution models, the eReefs platform also contains a Relocatable Coastal\nModel (RECOM) which offers higher resolution over smaller, user-defined areas. We do not yet cover the use of\nRECOM in these tutorials.\n[Learn more about RECOM.](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/models-about/recom/)\n:::\n\n\n\n## The *eReefs* Outputs\n\nThe core outputs from the *eReefs* platform are the datasets produced by the Hydrodynamic and Biogeochemical\nRegional Models. These datasets contain the predicted values across a range of variables for different points\nin time and three-dimensional space (latitude, longitude and depth in the water column and benthic layers).\nThe datasets are produced routinely in near-real-time, and hindcast into the past.

The data does not come from in-water\nmeasurements and thus will have a spatially varying level of error in the modelled values.\n\nFor further information on model accuracy and validation, see the\n[*eReefs* research paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/1755876X.2019.1650589).\n\nA [technical assessment of the skill level of the BGC version 3.1 model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2020/08/Reanalysis_v1_August2020.pdf)\nshows that the absolute accuracy of the BGC model varies significantly with variable and location. As a\nresult care should be taken to ensure the model is fit-for-purpose and in general BGC results should used in\ncombination with second sources of information when making inferences or management decisions.\n\nThe modelled scenarios run for version 3.1 of the BGC model were developed for the purpose of comparing\ncatchment run off effect comparison. As such they were driven with historic weather and river flow boundary\nconditions, but the sediment and nutrient loads were based on the results of the 2019 Source Catchment\nmodelling. In this catchment modelling the land use is static over the simulation run. This means that for\nthe 'Baseline' scenario this uses estimated land use from 2019 applied over all years (2010 - 2019). As a\nresult improvements in land practices are effectively back dated to start of the simulation (2010). This\nresults in early years in the simulation having slightly lower nutrient and sediment loads then actually\nhappened. The BGC modelling team indicated this approach is likely to introduce small additional errors in\nplaces where the land practices have improved significantly, but are likely to be smaller than the inherent\nerrors in the model. These errors only apply if the Baseline model data is interpreted as an estimate of\nhistoric conditions, rather than the original intended purpose of the scenario comparison.\n\nThe wind data used for the Hydrodynamic model is originally from the BOM Access-R weather models. These\nmodels capture synoptic winds and some of the features of cyclones, however they do not represent the high\nspeed winds near the eye of cyclones well. For this reason the maximum wind speed aggregations do not capture\nthe peak winds of cyclones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Learn more {#sec-learnMore}\n\n* [A video presentation on the *eReefs* platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYtlU-iMC0M)\n* [The 'eReefs Research' website](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/)\n* [The research paper \"eReefs: An operational information system for managing the Great Barrier Reef\"](https://doi.org/10.1080/1755876X.2019.1650589)\n* [The CSIRO Enironmental Modelling Suite (EMS) documentation](https://research.csiro.au/cem/software/ems/ems-documentation/)\n",
