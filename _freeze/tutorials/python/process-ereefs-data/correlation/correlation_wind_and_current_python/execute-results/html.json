As the wind picks up, at some speed the\nwind overpowers the EAC and the surface current moves in the direction of the wind.\n\nWe will use the [AIMS eReefs extraction tool](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/) to extract data for two\nlocations of interest:\n\n* Myrmidon Reef which is on the far outer edge of the GBR and is almost right in the middle of the southern\nEastern Australian Current; and\n\n* Davies Reef which is further in the reef matrix, but in a similar sector of the GBR.\n\n<!-- The locations of these two reefs are shown in @fig-site-locations. -->\n\nWe then process the data and investigate the relationship between the strength of the wind and the direction\nof the surface currents for the two locations.\n\n\n## Analysis method\n\nTo determine the relation between the wind and the surface currents we will use the AIMS eReefs extraction\ntool to pull out hourly time series wind and current data for our two locations of interest. We will then\nlook at the correlation between the wind and current vectors, where a correlation of 1 indicates they are\npointing in the same direction, and -1 indicated they are in opposite directions.\n\n\n## Setting up to get the data\n\nTo extract the time series data using the extraction tool we need to create a CSV file containing the sites\nof interest. This file needs to contain the coordinates and names of the sites. To create this I first added\nmy points manually in Google Earth Pro. This was done to simply get the location of Myrmidon and Davies\nReefs. Using Google Earth to create your CSV file for the extraction tool is only useful if you don't already\nknow the coordinates of your sites.\n\n\n[Screenshot of Google Earth Pro with Myromidon and Davies reef sites](images/google-earth-reef-locatons.jpg)\n\nThe points can be added using the `Add placemark` tool (looks like a pin). The locations can be seen by\ndisplaying the placemark properties. The resulting KML file can be found here:\n[extraction-tool-locations.kml](resources/extraction-tool-locations.kml).\n\nThe location of the two sites were copied to create the\n[CSV file for the data extraction tool](resources/site_coordinates.csv).\n\n\n## Extracting the data\n\nThe CSV file was uploaded to the [AIMS extraction tool](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/) and the\nextraction was performed with the following settings:\n\n* *Data collection*: GBR1 Hydro (Version 2)\n\n* *Variables*:\n  - Eastward wind speed (`wspeed_u`)\n  - Northward wind speed (`wspeed_v`)\n  - Northward current (`v`)\n  - Eastward current (`u`)\n\n* *Date range*: 1 January 2019 - 31 December 2019\n\n* *Time step*: hourly\n\n* *Depths*: -2.35 m\n\nOnce the extraction request was submitted the dataset was created after an one hour of processing the data\nwas available for download from [Extraction request: Example dataset: Wind-vs-Current at Davies and Myrmidon\nReefs (2019)](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/data/2009.c451dc3).\n\n## Downloading the data\n\nIn this notebook we will download the data using scripting. There is no need to re-run the extraction request\nas each extraction performed by the extraction tool has a permanent public page created for it that can be\nused to facilitate sharing of the data.\n\nLet's first create a temporary folder to contain the downloaded data. Note: The temp folder is excluded using\nthe .gitignore so it is not saved to the code repository, which is why we must reproduce it.\n\n::: {#92c97fbb .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport os\nif not os.path.exists('temp'):\n  os.makedirs('temp')\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's download the data. The file to download is 12.9 MB and so this download might take a little while.\nTo allow us to re-run this script without having to wait for the download each time we first check that the\ndownload has not already been done.\n\n::: {#2a9fdb6c .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport urllib.request\nextractionfile = os.path.join('temp','2009.c451dc3-collected.csv')  # Use os.path.join so the script will work cross-platform\n\nif not os.path.exists(extractionfile):\n  print(\"Downloading extraction data ...\")\n  url = 'https://api.ereefs.aims.gov.au/data-extraction/request/2009.c451dc3/files/2009.c451dc3-collected.csv'\n  req = urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, extractionfile)\n  print(req)\nelse:\n  print(\"Skipping redownloading extraction data\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSkipping redownloading extraction data\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Reading and cleaning the data\n\nRead the resulting CSV file into a\n[Pandas data frame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html).\n\n::: {#694430ea .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom janitor import clean_names\ndf = pd.read_csv(extractionfile).clean_names()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#d47b58d5 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(repr(df.head()))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#5e80d556 .cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>aggregated_date_time</th>\n      <th>variable</th>\n      <th>depth</th>\n      <th>site_name</th>\n      <th>latitude</th>\n      <th>longitude</th>\n      <th>mean</th>\n      <th>median</th>\n      <th>p5</th>\n      <th>p95</th>\n      <th>lowest</th>\n      <th>highest</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_u</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_u</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Davies Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.822840</td>\n      <td>147.645209</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_v</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_v</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Davies Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.822840</td>\n      <td>147.645209</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>v</td>\n      <td>-2.35</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first thing we might notice about the data is that, somewhat confusingly, we have a bunch of aggregation\nstatistics (mean, median, p5, p95, lowest, highest) which all take the same value. This is because we have\nextracted hourly \"aggregated\" data, but the time step for the eReefs model is also hourly. Therefore each row\nrepresents an aggregation over a single data point. Don't worry if you are confused by this, it's not\nimportant. Just think of this as a quirk of the eReefs data extraction tool. We'll clean this up now by\nreplacing the aggregation statistics with a single column called `value` and rename `aggregated_date_time` to\n`date_time`, to avoid any further confusion.\n\n::: {#81965427 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Create 'value' column, remove aggregation statistic columns, rename aggregated_date_time\ndf2 = df.\\\n  assign(value = df['mean']).\\\n  drop(columns=['mean', 'median', 'p5', 'p95', 'lowest','highest']).\\\n  rename(columns={\"aggregated_date_time\": \"date_time\"})\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#f34bd5ac .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(repr(df2.head()))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#75d6ac8b .cell execution_count=9}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>date_time</th>\n      <th>variable</th>\n      <th>depth</th>\n      <th>site_name</th>\n      <th>latitude</th>\n      <th>longitude</th>\n      <th>value</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_u</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_u</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Davies Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.822840</td>\n      <td>147.645209</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_v</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_v</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Davies Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.822840</td>\n      <td>147.645209</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>v</td>\n      <td>-2.35</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMuch better! Now it is clear to see that the data is in long format. That is, a single row for each value and\na separate column describing the meaning of the value --- in this case the column `variable` describes what\nthe column `value` means. Converting the data into [tidy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) format will\nhelp with subsequent analyses (and is probably also the format you are most comfortable working with). When\ndata is in tidy format, each variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each value\nhas its own cell.\n\nIf we think of the wind and current velocities as the things being \"measured\", then the observations in the\ndataset are the values of the measurements for each time point at each site. Therefore we would like a single\nrow for each unique combination of `date_time` and `site_name` (or `latitude` and `longitude` pair).

That's because wind speed implies a `NA` depth value (coded as 10000m in the extracted data) and\ncurrent implies a depth of -2.35m (as this is the only depth we chose to extract). Therefore we can just\nremove depth entirely from our dataset without losing any information, that is, as long as we remember that\nthe current relates to a depth of -2.35m. For the forgetful among us, we could rename the current variables\nto `v_2.35m` and `u_2.35m`.

The dot product can be calculated as\n\n$$\na \\cdot b = a_x \\times b_x + a_y \\times b_y\n$$\n\nand the magnitude of the vectors as\n\n$$\n||a|| = \\sqrt{a^2_x + a^2_y} \\;\\;, \\; \\;\\;\\;\\;\n||b|| = \\sqrt{b^2_x + b^2_y}\n$$\n\n::: {#fb132c97 .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\ndf_corr = df_tidy\ndf_corr['currentmag'] = np.sqrt(df_corr['u']**2 + df_corr['v']**2)\ndf_corr['windmag'] = np.sqrt(df_corr['wspeed_u']**2 + df_corr['wspeed_v']**2)\ndf_corr['windcurrentcorr'] = (df_corr['u'] * df_corr['wspeed_u']  +  df_corr['v'] * df_corr['wspeed_v']) / (df_corr['currentmag'] * df_corr['windmag'])\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#f2c3b8a5 .cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(repr(df_corr.head()))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#c0622b44 .cell execution_count=18}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=12}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>variable</th>\n      <th>u</th>\n      <th>v</th>\n      <th>wspeed_u</th>\n      <th>wspeed_v</th>\n      <th>currentmag</th>\n      <th>windmag</th>\n      <th>windcurrentcorr</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>site_name</th>\n      <th>latitude</th>\n      <th>longitude</th>\n      <th>date_time</th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"top\">Davies Reef</th>\n      <th rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"top\">-18.82284</th>\n      <th rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"top\">147.645209</th>\n      <th>2019-01-01T00:00</th>\n      <td>-0.048835</td>\n      <td>0.100391</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>0.111638</td>\n      <td>9.298236</td>\n      <td>0.684380</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2019-01-01T01:00</th>\n      <td>-0.090807</td>\n      <td>-0.036129</td>\n      <td>-8.749271</td>\n      <td>2.753487</td>\n      <td>0.097730</td>\n      <td>9.172319</td>\n      <td>0.775325</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2019-01-01T02:00</th>\n      <td>-0.118289</td>\n      <td>-0.180480</td>\n      <td>-8.463824</td>\n      <td>2.587230</td>\n      <td>0.215790</td>\n      <td>8.850428</td>\n      <td>0.279727</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2019-01-01T03:00</th>\n      <td>-0.110750</td>\n      <td>-0.278911</td>\n      <td>-8.223801</td>\n      <td>2.112059</td>\n      <td>0.300094</td>\n      <td>8.490683</td>\n      <td>0.126259</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2019-01-01T04:00</th>\n      <td>-0.079472</td>\n      <td>-0.312360</td>\n      <td>-8.565171</td>\n      <td>2.711215</td>\n      <td>0.322311</td>\n      <td>8.984033</td>\n      <td>-0.057391</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's look at the relationship between the wind and current as a function of the wind speed.
