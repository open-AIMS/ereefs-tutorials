During winter months the wind moves in a north eastern direction in the near opposite direction to the EAC. When the wind is low the surface currents are dominated by the EAC. As the wind picks up, at some speed the wind overpowers the EAC and the surface current moves in the direction of the wind.\n\nWe will use the [AIMS eReefs extraction tool](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/) to extract data for two locations of interest:\n\n* Myrmidon Reef which is on the far outer edge of the GBR and is almost right in the middle of the southern Eastern Australian Current; and\n\n* Davies Reef which is further in the reef matrix, but in a similar sector of the GBR.\n\nThe locations of these two reefs are shown in @fig-site-locations.\n\nWe then process the data and investigate the relationship between the strength of the wind and the direction of the surface currents for the two locations.\n\n\n## Analysis method\n\nTo determine the relation between the wind and the surface currents we will use the AIMS eReefs extraction tool to pull out hourly time series wind and current data for our two locations of interest. We will then look at the correlation between the wind and current vectors, where a correlation of 1 indicates they are pointing in the same direction, and -1 indicated they are in opposite directions.\n\n\n## Setting up to get the data\n\nTo extract the time series data using the extraction tool we need to create a CSV file containing the sites of interest. This file needs to contain the coordinates and names of the sites. To create this I first added my points manually in Google Earth Pro. This was done to simply get the location of Myrmidon and Davies Reefs. Using Google Earth to create your CSV file for the extraction tool is only useful if you don't already know the coordinates of your sites.\n\n\n[Screenshot of Google Earth Pro with Myromidon and Davies reef sites](images/google-earth-reef-locatons.jpg)\n\nThe points can be added using the `Add placemark` tool (looks like a pin). The locations can be seen by displaying the placemark properties. The resulting KML file can be found [here](resources/extraction-tool-locations.kml).\n\nThe location of the two sites were copied to create the [CSV file for the data extraction tool](resources/site_coordinates.csv).\n\n\n## Extracting the data\n\nThe CSV file was uploaded to the [AIMS extraction tool](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/) and the extraction was performed with the following settings: \n\n* *Data collection*: GBR1 Hydro (Version 2) \n\n* *Variables*: \n    - Eastward wind speed (`wspeed_u`)\n    - Northward wind speed (`wspeed_v`)\n    - Northward current (`v`)\n    - Eastward current (`u`) \n\n* *Date range*: 1 January 2019 - 31 December 2019 \n\n* *Time step*: hourly \n\n* *Depths*: -2.35 m\n\nOnce the extraction request was submitted the dataset was created after an one hour of processing the data was available for download from [Extraction request: Example dataset: Wind-vs-Current at Davies and Myrmidon Reefs (2019)](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/data/2009.c451dc3).\n\n## Downloading the data\n\nIn this notebook we will download the data using scripting. There is no need to re-run the extraction request as each extraction performed by the extraction tool has a permanent public page created for it that can be used to facilitate sharing of the data.\n\nLet's first create a temporary folder to contain the downloaded data. Note: The temp folder is excluded using the .gitignore so it is not saved to the code repository, which is why we must reproduce it.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport os\nif not os.path.exists('temp'):\n    os.makedirs('temp')\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's download the data. The file to download is 12.9 MB and so this download might take a little while. To allow us to re-run this script without having to wait for the download each time we first check that the download has not already been done.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport urllib.request\nextractionfile = os.path.join('temp','2009.c451dc3-collected.csv')  # Use os.path.join so the script will work cross-platform\n\nif not os.path.exists(extractionfile):\n    print(\"Downloading extraction data ...\")\n    url = 'https://api.ereefs.aims.gov.au/data-extraction/request/2009.c451dc3/files/2009.c451dc3-collected.csv'\n    req = urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, extractionfile)\n    print(req)\nelse:\n    print(\"Skipping redownloading extraction data\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSkipping redownloading extraction data\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Reading and cleaning the data\n\nRead the resulting CSV file into a [Pandas data frame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html).\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(extractionfile)\ndf.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Aggregated Date/Time</th>\n      <th>Variable</th>\n      <th>Depth</th>\n      <th>Site Name</th>\n      <th>Latitude</th>\n      <th>Longitude</th>\n      <th>mean</th>\n      <th>median</th>\n      <th>p5</th>\n      <th>p95</th>\n      <th>lowest</th>\n      <th>highest</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_u</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_u</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Davies Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.822840</td>\n      <td>147.645209</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_v</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_v</td>\n      <td>99999.90</td>\n      <td>Davies Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.822840</td>\n      <td>147.645209</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>v</td>\n      <td>-2.35</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we can see that data is in [tidy format](https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-tidy-data-how-to-organize-messy-datasets-in-python-with-melt-and-pivotable-functions-5d52daa996c9). That is each observation is in one row per time step, variable, depth and site. For each of these combinations there are summary statistics corresponding to the aggregation process that was applied. Somewhat confusingly we extracted hourly data from the hourly eReefs hydrodynamic model and so there was no aggregation applied. As a result all the stats values are the same and the mean corresponds to the actual extracted data values. Let's clean this up a little by removing the redundant columns. Here we also drop the depth variable as the depth of the wind doesn't match the depth of the surface current and so makes it difficult to align the wind and the current together. Since we are only processing a single depth this is an OK simplification. If we were processing the current at multiple depths then we would need a more complex set of data wraggling.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf2 = df.drop(columns=['median', 'p5', 'p95', 'lowest','highest','Depth']).rename(columns={\"mean\": \"value\"})\ndf2.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Aggregated Date/Time</th>\n      <th>Variable</th>\n      <th>Site Name</th>\n      <th>Latitude</th>\n      <th>Longitude</th>\n      <th>value</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_u</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>-9.568488</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_u</td>\n      <td>Davies Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.822840</td>\n      <td>147.645209</td>\n      <td>-8.880175</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_v</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>3.260430</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>wspeed_v</td>\n      <td>Davies Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.822840</td>\n      <td>147.645209</td>\n      <td>2.756750</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>2019-01-01T00:00</td>\n      <td>v</td>\n      <td>Myrmidon Reef</td>\n      <td>-18.265599</td>\n      <td>147.389028</td>\n      <td>0.047311</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext we need to align the wind and current values for a given time step and site on to the same rows of data.

This is not surprising given that we are considering just the hourly samples, with no consideration for how long the wind has been blowing. At low wind conditions the current has an even chance of being aligned with the wind (correlation $r= 1$) as in the opposite direction (correlation $r= -1$), however in high wind we can see that there is much more chance that the currents are aligned with the wind.\n\nTo understand this relationship better we want to understand how much the wind nudges the current in its direction. If we bin the wind speeds then collect all the correlation samples in each bin then we can see if they average to zero (indicating that there is no relationship between the wind and current) or there is average alignment.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom scipy import stats\nwind = davies[\"windmag\"]\ncurrent = davies[\"windcurrentcorr\"]\nbin_means, bin_edges, binnumber = stats.binned_statistic(wind, current, 'mean', bins=20)\nplt.hlines(bin_means, bin_edges[:-1], bin_edges[1:], colors='g', lw=5,\n           label='Davies Reef')\n\nwind = myrmidon[\"windmag\"]\ncurrent = myrmidon[\"windcurrentcorr\"]\nbin_means, bin_edges, binnumber = stats.binned_statistic(wind, current, 'mean', bins=20)\nplt.hlines(bin_means, bin_edges[:-1], bin_edges[1:], colors='r', lw=5,\n           label='Myrmidon Reef')\n\nplt.xlabel('Wind speed (m/s)')\nplt.ylabel('Wind-current correlation')\nplt.title('Mean correlation between wind and surface current (hourly data, 2019)')\nplt.legend()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\n```\n<matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x1decfb40760>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](correlation_wind_and_current_python_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-2.png){width=615 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom this we can see that for wind speeds below 8 m/s the surface current direction is unrelated to the wind. Above this wind speed the surface current is increasingly determined by the direction of the wind. By the time the wind is 16 m/s the direction of the surface current is dominated by the wind direction.\n\n:::{.callout-caution appearance=\"simple\"}\nIt should be remembered that this analysis is based on the eReefs Hydrodynamic model and as such is not based on real data. The eReefs model has however been tuned to accurately capture the flow dynamics of the GBR and so we would expect the estimates from this analysis to be approximately correct.\n:::\n\n",
